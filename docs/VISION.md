## 💡 Core Concept: Dual-Platform Marketplace

### Individual Vendor Portals
Each vendor gets their own:
- Custom storefront/portal
- Product management system
- Sales tracking & analytics
- Customer relationship tools
- Inventory management

### Main Warehouse Ecommerce Platform
- **Opt-in Marketplace:** Vendors can click "Join the Main Web" to list their products on the larger platform
- **Unified Search:** When customers search for items, they see products from ALL participating stores
- **Increased Visibility:** Vendors benefit from the platform's traffic and marketing

### How It Works
